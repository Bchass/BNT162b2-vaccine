# BNT162b2-vaccine
The point of this challenge is to create an algorithm to figure out the RNA sequence of the BNT162b2-vaccine.

Came across:
- [Reverse Engineering the source code of the BioNTech/Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/) 
- [Reverse Engineering Source Code of the Biontech Pfizer Vaccine: Part 2](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/part-2-reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/)

All the data and information can be found through both posts, pretty fun challenge so far. Currently have the algorithm at 62% efficeincy after some modification.
